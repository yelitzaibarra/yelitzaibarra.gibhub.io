Maybe you've thrown a crumbled paper to the trash and said "KOBE" while you were at it. But that tradition now lays in our memory. Now instead of saying "KOBE" we say "FOR KOBE". The death of his and his daughted Gigi devastated everyone. Wheather you were his fan or not, you cant help but feel some type of empathy and orsympathy for the bryant family that changed and marked a special place in our childhoods forever.
